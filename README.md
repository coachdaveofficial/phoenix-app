## Introduction

This project was inspired by the amount of data collected for Phoenix FC by its club manager. 
Since 2010, the club has kept track of player stats, team stats, and many more data. 
Now that the club has grown to manage 3 teams, I wanted to make a homepage for Phoenix FC that would showcase all these statistics in a way that would be helpful to current and prospective players.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.JS
- Backend: Flask/Python
- Database: PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy


## Features

Here are the current key features:

- Preview upcoming and previous match stats
- Display current players with most goals and most assists through club history
- Display players current stats for the season (top goalscorer, etc.)
- Import match data from Google Sheets and use script file to insert formatted data into database

## Goals

Here are my goals for new features to be added:

- Authentication and Authorization to manage access to script
- Player to Player stat comparison
- Landing pages to each team in the club
- Reminders for upcoming matches
